1. First, install required packages:
pip install google-generativeai langchain-google-genai

2. Create a .env file in your project root:
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

3. Here's the code you can add to your existing main.py 

import google.generativeai as genai
from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

# Configure the Gemini API
GOOGLE_API_KEY = os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")
genai.configure(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)

# Initialize the chat model
llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model="gemini-pro")

# Create a conversation chain with memory
conversation = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm,
    memory=ConversationBufferMemory(),
    verbose=True
)

print("\nStarting interactive chat (type 'quit' to exit):")
while True:
    user_input = input("\nYou: ")
    if user_input.lower() == 'quit':
        break
        
    response = conversation.predict(input=user_input)
    print("\nAI:", response)


4. Sample input and output:
Here's what a sample conversation with this code would look like:

Starting interactive chat (type 'quit' to exit):

You: What is artificial intelligence?

AI: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Here are the key aspects:

1. Core capabilities:
- Learning from experience (Machine Learning)
- Understanding natural language
- Recognizing patterns
- Making decisions
- Solving problems

2. Types of AI:
- Narrow/Weak AI (designed for specific tasks)
- General/Strong AI (hypothetical systems with human-like general intelligence)

You: What are its real world applications?

AI: Here are some major real-world applications of artificial intelligence:

1. Healthcare:
- Disease diagnosis
- Drug discovery
- Medical imaging analysis
- Patient care monitoring

2. Business:
- Customer service chatbots
- Fraud detection
- Market analysis
- Recommendation systems

3. Transportation:
- Self-driving vehicles
- Traffic management
- Route optimization
- Predictive maintenance

4. Daily Life:
- Virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa)
- Social media algorithms
- Smart home devices
- Email spam filters

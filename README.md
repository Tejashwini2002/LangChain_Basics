This was the first langchain project created during learining langchain.
I've used Gemini API KEY. Always API Keys must be kept secret and should not be shared pubicly. So while commiting to github using git commands, you will not include .env file where all your api keys will be there.

Notes for myself: To drag and drop files, inside any repository, click on the + icon which is present beside "Go to file" button and then click on upload files and then just select all your files from their location and just drag and drop. All files will come easily at once. Then click in commit changes button.
